Assignment: Create Self-Posting Form 

This assignment will use your eventForms.php as the basis for the assignment. 

Make a copy of your eventsForm.php and call it processEvents.php. 

Convert the processEvents.php form page into a self posting form using PHP and the supplied algorithm.

When submitted the form should send the form data to the server to the same page.
The data should be inserted into your database table.
Use PHP to place the form data back into the form fields.
Return the filled out form back to the user.
When finished post your hosting account and include a link when you submit the assignment on Blackboard.
